# pr-workflow-test

notes to self: 

- you need to rebuild the index.js files everytime you want to changes in main.ts to take effect

- also note that the way you're testing is highly manual 

- remember to commit to the right branch 

<!-- # todo standardizing between index.js and main.ts? -->

# Documentation for workflow project is [in another md folder](./workflow-automation.md)
