## lint

The teammates repo uses some angular thing to lint ts files, im not sure if i should do the same so im installing eslint instead...
npm install eslint --save-dev

but im not sure what style guide to use at the moment, just set google code style to be used (tho it does require another dependency)

Setting up the lint literally takes so much time and still doesn't work..

[ ] try using the angular thing in teammates for linting, tho that could mean inconsistent files..
